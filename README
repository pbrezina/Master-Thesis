SSSD provider for OpenLMI

A long-standing problem in Linux system administration is how to monitor,
configure and manage a large number of systems remotely.

The emerging OpenLMI project aims at simplifying remote Linux system
administration using a set of APIs based on industry standards such as CIM,
that allow the developer to create a module - a "provider" to manage any aspect
of a Linux system locally or remotely.

The goal of this thesis is to create a provider that allows the administrator
to manage the SSSD using the OpenLMI framework. In particular the thesis will
include:

* Overview of both SSSD deamon and the OpenLMI framework

* Discussion of different aspects of managing the SSSD including a list of
  tasks that the OpenLMI plugin will expose. This part of thesis may expose
  functionality that is missing in the SSSD.

* Design and implementation of a provider for the OpenLMI framework that will
  allow the administrator to manage the SSSD

* The design and implementation must be agreed on with the SSSD and OpenLMI
  development teams
