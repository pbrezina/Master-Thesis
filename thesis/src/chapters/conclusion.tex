\chapter{Conclusion}

This, however, included an extensive research of the Web-Based Enterprise
Management and related standards. In addition to an expected contribution of a
new code to the OpenLMI project the thesis also required a lot of contribution
to the SSSD project including a new code, new public library, bug fixes and code
reviews. I also contributed to the Augeas library.
